This project is a small collection of sockets related apps, without GUIs. After my first chatapp I decided to make another one, that could be run from command line. That way it could be run on linux/mac with the use of Mono.

Also, this chatapp allows you to connect and act as a server, without the need for a server/client pair app.

The purpose of these projects were mostly just to learn C#, .NET, sockets, and general networking.
